# Team Management CFP 2017

My first attempt at CFP on a talk I want to give on dev team management.

## Elevator Pitch
> You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

## Description
> You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

## Notes
> This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...
